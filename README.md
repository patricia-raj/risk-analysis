# Risk Analysis

## Context:
 Investors loan people money without using a bank and so investors always want to mitigate risk when considering Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation.
 Here are several machine learning models build and evaluate considering to predict credit risk using data e from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem meaning the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans.
 
 To best analysis and predict the risk here are few different techniques implemented for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. 
 
## Libraries used to build and evaluate models:
    - Imbalanced-learn 
    - Scikit-learn libraries  

## Techniques employed are:
    - Resampling
    - Ensemble Learning

## Evaluation Metrics under consideration
    - Balanced Accuracy Score
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Imbalanced classification report 
      (Precision, Recall and Mean Geo scores)
